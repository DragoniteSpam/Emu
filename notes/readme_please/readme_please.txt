I've changed some of Scribble's default values. If you ever manually update
the version of Scribble that this system uses, you will most likely want to
re-edit the default values otherwise the visual appearance may change.

    global.scribble_state_starting_color in scribble_reset is now EMU_COLOR_DEFAULT
