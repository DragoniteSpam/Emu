Guess I should probably keep a changelog now. See the documentation for more details:

# Changes since 1.1.0

Additions:

 - All Render() methods now accept an option debug_draw argument, which draws a bounding box around each element's, well, bounding box
 - EmuList::ForEachSelection and ::GetAllSelectedIndices
 - EmuList::FitToBox - allows you to specify a total width and height for the element, without having to predict the size given slot height and slot count
 - EmuList::SetNumbered
 - EmuList::GetSelectedItem - returns the value at the currently selected index, or undefined
 - EmuList::At so you can get the selected entry without mucking around with the `entries` property
 - EmuInput::SetValueType and ::SetCharacterLimit
 - EmuInput::SetStrictInput - will reject invalid input instead of showing a warning (I usually don't do this)
 - E_InputTypes.LETTERSDIGITS and LETTERSDIGITSANDUNDERSCORES

Bugs fixed:

 - EmuCore only renders content elements if the element is enabled
 - EmuList::Select will not select a value outside the range of its list
 - EmuInput input can be processed with input elements set to Require Enter

# Version 1.1.0 - Changes since 1.0.17

Some of these changes will be breaking; make a backup before updating.

 - General: removed array accessors and the need for copy-on-write (GMS2 version 2022.2 or later will be needed)
 - General: EMU_AUTO_NO_SPACING
 - Bitfields: renamed auto functions to make them a tiny bit more orderly
 - Bitfields: added emu_bitfield_option_callback_toggle and emu_bitfield_option_eval_includes bitfield auto functions
 - Display: UI element sprites are now macros (as colors were made to be in 1.0.17)

# Version 1.0.17 - Changes since 1.0.16

Some of these changes will be breaking; make a backup before updating.

 - General: the system is now entirely garbage collected, and ::Destroy() methods have been removed
 - General: EMU_INLINE and EMU_BASE alignment options
 - Dialogs: added ::AddDefaultCloseButton and ::AddDefaultConfirmCancelButtons to save you from having to add such things yourself every single time
 - Display: color values are now macros - you can reskin the UI by having the macros point to global variables instead of color literals
 - Element IDs: added EmuCore::SetID, EmuCore::GetSibling, EmuCore::GetChild, EmuCore::SearchID
     - You can assign element IDs to elements and use them to reference each other without the need to save each element as a variable elsewhere
     - Advancement (via the Tab and Shift+Tab keys) can now be set using element IDs
 - EmuInput: better text entry
 - Refresh functions: added EmuCore::SetRefresh and EmuCore::SetRefresh
     - This lets you call .Refresh() on any element (or container element) to update the text or values of an element at any time
 - Scribble: is now Version 8
